"""Scoped cleanup for the inspectable Neo4j memory demo.

Removes every Lab 6 record on the instance, not just the current run:

1. Workshop-owned ``ABOUT_HOTEL`` relationships.
2. Conversations, messages, and users in the ``demo08-`` namespace.
3. Preferences in the ``hotels-demo08-`` category namespace or tagged by this
   demo, but only after no user owns them.

The session and user sweeps match the bare ``demo08-`` prefix with no run id,
which is deliberate: it is what makes an interrupted earlier run recoverable.
The consequence is that on a Neo4j instance shared by several participants,
one participant running this script deletes every participant's Lab 6
records, including runs still in progress. Run it against a shared instance
only when everyone is finished.

The hotel graph, its chunk indexes, and other modules' data are untouched.
The library-managed memory vector indexes stay in place: they are shared
infrastructure, they cost nothing while empty, and the smoke test checks
them.

Requires live Neo4j credentials but no AWS access. Without them the script
prints a skip message and exits 0.

Run with:
    uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt python cleanup_memory.py
