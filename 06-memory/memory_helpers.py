"""Memory client construction for the inspectable Neo4j memory demo.

Builds a ``neo4j-agent-memory`` :class:`MemoryClient` over the same Aura
instance as the hotel knowledge graph, so memory nodes (``Conversation``,
``Message``, ``Preference``, ``User``) land beside the domain nodes where
they can be inspected with plain Cypher.

The construction pattern is adapted from the earlier GraphRAG workshop's
``Lab_5_Agent_Memory/lib/memory_utils.py`` and solves the same non-obvious
problems:

- **Explicit embedder:** in ``neo4j-agent-memory`` 0.5.0 the client builds a
  concrete embedder from ``EmbeddingConfig`` for OpenAI and
  sentence-transformers only and returns ``None`` for every other provider,
  including Bedrock (``MemoryClient._create_embedder``). Left that way, the
  client has no embedder and ``generate_embedding=True`` silently writes
  zero-length vectors, so semantic recall finds nothing. The Bedrock embedder
  is therefore constructed explicitly here and passed via ``embedder=``.
- **Pinned dimensions:** ``EmbeddingConfig`` defaults to OpenAI's 1536
  dimensions. The memory vector indexes must match the vectors Titan Text
  Embeddings V2 actually produces, so dimensions are pinned to 1024.
- **Explicit database:** the library's ``Neo4jConfig`` passes its ``database``
  on every session, which overrides home-database routing. The target database
  is read from ``NEO4J_DATABASE`` so instances whose single database is not
  named ``neo4j`` still work.

Two choices are specific to this demo:

- **Titan Text Embeddings V2, not Nova:** the library's Bedrock embedder
  supports Titan and Cohere request formats only. The memory layer owns its
  own vector indexes, separate from the ``hotel_chunk_embeddings`` index, so
  this is a deliberately separate embedding contract from the workshop's
  pinned Nova chunk embeddings, not a conflict.
- **Multi-tenant mode is on:** every memory write must carry a
  ``user_identifier``, and the store raises ``ValueError`` for any write that
  omits one. That makes the demo's actor-isolation lesson structural rather
  than conventional.

No credentials are read and no connection is opened at import time; both
happen inside :func:`load_config` and ``MemoryClient.connect``.
