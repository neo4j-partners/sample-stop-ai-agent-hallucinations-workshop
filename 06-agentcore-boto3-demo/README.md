# Production-Ready Booking Agent on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (boto3 + Notebook)

Deploy all anti-hallucination techniques from the previous demos in this series (01-05) to production using [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/) — driven entirely from a single Jupyter notebook with boto3. No CDK required.

[![Lambda](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Lambda-orange.svg?style=flat&logo=aws-lambda)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
[![Neo4j](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neo4j-AuraDB-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/)

This demo uses [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). Similar patterns apply with LangGraph, AutoGen, or other agent frameworks that support AgentCore Runtime.

## What This Demo Shows

Demos 01-05 demonstrate techniques that significantly reduce hallucinations. This demo takes those techniques to production:

| Technique (from demos) | Production implementation |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Semantic tool selection** (demo 02) | [AgentCore Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) with MCP (Model Context Protocol) semantic routing — no custom FAISS index needed |
| **Multi-agent validation** (demo 03) | `validate_booking_rules` tool backed by [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) — same safety, lower latency |
| **Neurosymbolic guardrails** (demo 04) | Steering rules in [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) — change rules without redeploying the agent |
| **Agent Control steering** (demo 05) | STEER messages in DynamoDB rules — agent self-corrects instead of failing |
| **Graph-RAG** (demo 01) | [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/) with a `query_knowledge_graph` [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (optional, auto-detected) |

---

## Workshop vs. Self-Paced

This demo adapts to your environment automatically.

**At an AWS event:** Neo4j runs on the Code Editor EC2. The notebook detects the private IP, Security Group, and Neo4j password secret ARN from CloudFormation outputs — no manual configuration needed.

**Self-paced:** Set `NEO4J_HOST` manually in the notebook's configuration cell to your own Neo4j instance (AuraDB URI, local Docker, etc.). If no Neo4j is configured, the notebook deploys without the graph query tool — the booking agent still works fully.

See [Neo4j Setup (self-paced)](#neo4j-setup-self-paced) for step-by-step instructions.

## What Gets Deployed

| Component | AWS Service | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Data layer | [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) (3 tables) | Hotels catalog, reservations, steering rules |
| Booking tools | [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (7 functions) | search, book, pay, confirm, cancel, validate |
| Graph query tool | [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (1 function, VPC) | Cypher queries to Neo4j knowledge graph (optional) |
| Tool routing | [AgentCore Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) (MCP) | Semantic tool discovery and invocation |
| Agent | [AgentCore Runtime](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) | Hosts the Strands agent with Amazon Bedrock |
| Guardrails | Hooks + DynamoDB rules | Hard blocks (hooks) + soft steering (STEER messages) |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **[Python](https://python.org/downloads) 3.11+** installed
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** package manager ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)** installed and configured with credentials for your account
- **Amazon Bedrock access** — enable `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` (or equivalent) in your region via the [Bedrock Model Access console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess)

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd 06-agentcore-boto3-demo
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Open and run the deployment notebook

```bash
# Open in VS Code, Kiro, or any IDE with notebook support
code deploy_agentcore.ipynb
```

The notebook walks through every step in order:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Configure AWS clients and detect Neo4j (workshop) or set manually (self-paced) |
| 1 | Create DynamoDB tables (Hotels, Bookings, SteeringRules) |
| 2 | Seed 18 hotels across 18 cities worldwide |
| 3 | Seed 6 steering rules with STEER self-correction messages |
| 4 | Create IAM roles (Lambda execution + AgentCore execution) |
| 5 | Deploy 7 Lambda booking tools |
| 6 | Deploy Neo4j query Lambda with VPC config (if Neo4j detected) |
| 7 | Create AgentCore Gateway with MCP semantic routing |
| 8 | Register Lambda tools as Gateway targets |
| 9 | Deploy Strands agent to AgentCore Runtime via `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` |
| 10 | Run 7 test scenarios against the live agent |

Every cell is **idempotent** — if a resource already exists, the cell finds it and continues. You can re-run any cell or restart from any point.

### Step 3: Test the deployed agent

After Step 9 completes, test via AWS CLI:

```bash
aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime \
    --agent-runtime-arn <RUNTIME_ARN from notebook output> \
    --payload '{"prompt": "Find hotels in Paris under $120"}' \
    --region us-east-1 /tmp/response.json && cat /tmp/response.json
```

Or continue running the test cells directly in the notebook (Step 10).

---

## Neo4j Setup (Self-Paced)

### What is Neo4j AuraDB?

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database that stores data as nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns. This lets the agent answer questions like "What amenities does the Grand Hotel have?" by traversing graph connections directly, instead of guessing from text chunks. See [demo 01](../01-graphrag-demo/) for a full explanation.

### Create a free Neo4j AuraDB instance

1. Go to [console.neo4j.io](https://console.neo4j.io) and create a free account
2. Click **New Instance** → **AuraDB Free**
3. Choose a name (e.g., `hotel-graphrag`) and region
4. **Download the credentials file** when prompted — it contains your URI, username, and password

### Configure in the notebook

In Step 0 of `deploy_agentcore.ipynb`, uncomment and set these values:

```python
NEO4J_HOST = "your-instance.databases.neo4j.io"   # From AuraDB console
NEO4J_SECRET_ARN = ""       # Create a Secrets Manager secret with your password
SECURITY_GROUP_ID = "sg-xxxxx"   # Your VPC security group
SUBNET_IDS = ["subnet-xxxxx"]    # Your VPC subnets (for Lambda VPC config)
```

> If no Neo4j is configured, the notebook skips the graph Lambda and deploys without it — the booking agent still works fully for hotel search, booking, payment, and cancellation.

---

## Steering Rules

Rules live in [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), not in code. Change agent behavior without redeploying:

```json
{
    "rule_id": "max-guests",
    "action": "book",
    "condition_field": "guests",
    "operator": "gt",
    "threshold": 10,
    "fail_message": "Guest count exceeds maximum of 10",
    "steer_message": "Booking for {guests} guests is not available, but you CAN book for up to 10 guests. Adjust to 10 guests, proceed with the booking, and tell the user.",
    "enabled": true
}
```

The agent calls `validate_booking_rules` before every booking action. When a rule is violated, it receives the `steer_message` — an instruction on how to self-correct — instead of a hard failure.

**To change a rule** (takes effect immediately, no redeploy):

```bash
aws dynamodb update-item \
    --table-name workshop-SteeringRules \
    --key '{"rule_id": {"S": "max-guests"}}' \
    --update-expression "SET threshold = :t" \
    --expression-attribute-values '{":t": {"N": "8"}}'
```

---

## Test Scenarios

| # | Scenario | Expected behavior |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Search hotels in Lisbon | Semantic routing → `search_available_hotels` → DynamoDB scan |
| 2 | Book for 15 guests (max 10) | `validate_booking_rules` → STEER: "adjusted to 10 guests" |
| 3 | Full flow: search → book → pay → confirm (same session) | CONFIRMED — multi-turn memory within session |
| 4 | AnyCompany Rome Centro (0 rooms) | `book_hotel` → "no available rooms" — no hallucination |
| 5 | Budget search under $100 | Cross-country search → finds cheapest hotels |
| 6 | Confirm without payment | Hard hook `BookingGuardrailsHook` BLOCKS → agent asks to pay first |
| 7 | Same-day booking | `validate_booking_rules` → STEER: "adjusted to tomorrow" |

## Observability

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides built-in observability when OpenTelemetry (OTel) dependencies are included in the agent package. The `agent_requirements.txt` includes:

```
strands-agents[otel]>=1.27.0
aws-opentelemetry-distro>=0.7.0
```

With these dependencies, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore automatically instruments Strands Agents — capturing:
- **Invocation logs** — every `invoke_agent_runtime` call
- **Tool call traces** — which Lambda was invoked, input/output, latency
- **Error tracking** — failed tool calls, guardrail blocks

Logs appear in [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) under `/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/`. See the [observability getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-get-started.html) for details.

---

## Latency Benchmarks

Tool latency matters in production agents — every tool call adds to end-to-end response time. These benchmarks measure real [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) execution duration from [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) REPORT lines, not CLI round-trip time.

### DynamoDB-backed tools

| Function | Cold start | Warm p50 | Warm p90 | Memory used |
|----------|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| `validate_booking_rules` | ~550-620 ms | ~25 ms | ~105 ms | 88 MB / 256 MB |
| `search_available_hotels` | ~540-660 ms | ~16 ms | ~43 ms | 88 MB / 256 MB |

**Key takeaways:**
- **Warm invocations are fast:** DynamoDB single-digit-ms reads translate to 10-30 ms Lambda execution for steering rule validation
- **Cold starts are predictable:** ~450-540 ms Init + ~110 ms execution = ~600 ms total, only on first invocation after idle period
- **Why this matters for steering:** `validate_booking_rules` runs before every booking action. At ~25 ms warm, it adds negligible latency while preventing hallucinated bookings that violate business rules

### Neo4j AuraDB (optional Graph-RAG tool)

| Function | Cold start | Warm p50 | Warm p90 | Memory used |
|----------|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| `query_knowledge_graph` | ~1.9-2.0 s | ~13 ms | ~75 ms | 122 MB / 256 MB |

[Neo4j AuraDB Free](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/) runs outside your VPC, but the [neo4j Python driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/) reuses TCP connections across warm invocations. After the first call, subsequent [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/) queries execute in 11-30 ms — comparable to DynamoDB. Cold starts are higher (~2s) due to driver initialization + TLS handshake + Secrets Manager lookup.

> **Benchmark methodology:** 10 consecutive invocations per function in `us-east-1`. Duration extracted from CloudWatch Lambda REPORT lines. Cold start = Init Duration + Duration. Warm = Duration only.

---

## Cleanup

Run `cleanup.py` to delete all resources created by the notebook:

```bash
uv run python cleanup.py
```

This removes: DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, AgentCore Gateway + targets, AgentCore Runtime, IAM roles, and the S3 bucket used for agent deployment.

> **Skip this if you are using an AWS-provided workshop account** — it will be cleaned up automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| `NoRegionError` | Set `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1` before running the notebook |
| Agent returns 500 error | Check [CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) under `/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/` |
| `ResourceNotFoundException` on Lambda | Re-run Step 5 in the notebook — Lambda deploy may have timed out |
| Neo4j Lambda fails to connect | Verify `NEO4J_HOST` and `SECURITY_GROUP_ID` allow inbound on port 7687 |
| `AccessDeniedException` on Bedrock | Enable the model in the [Bedrock Model Access console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess) |
| IAM propagation errors | The notebook waits 10s after IAM creation — retry the failing step after 30s |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and how does it work?

[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) is an AWS managed service for hosting AI agents in production. It provides a **Runtime** (agent container hosting with auto-scaling) and a **Gateway** (MCP-based semantic routing to tools). The agent connects to the Gateway via MCP (Model Context Protocol), which discovers and routes tool calls to Lambda functions — no custom routing code needed.

### Do I need AWS CDK to run this demo?

No. This demo uses `boto3` and the `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` to create all AWS resources directly from the Jupyter notebook (`deploy_agentcore.ipynb`). No CDK installation or bootstrap is required.

### How much does this deployment cost?

All services are pay-per-use. At workshop scale (a few dozen test invocations): DynamoDB on-demand (~$0), Lambda (~$0 for <1M requests/month free tier), AgentCore Runtime (see [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/)). Neo4j AuraDB Free is $0/month. Run `cleanup.py` after the workshop to avoid ongoing charges.

### Can I change the LLM from Bedrock to another provider?

Yes. Change the `BedrockModel` in `booking_agent.py` to any provider supported by Strands Agents: Anthropic API, Ollama (local models), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The tools, Lambda functions, and AgentCore Gateway remain unchanged — only the LLM call changes. See [Strands Model Providers](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/) for configuration.

### How are the steering rules different from the hard guardrails?

There are two distinct mechanisms: **Hard guardrails** (`BookingGuardrailsHook` in `booking_agent.py`) enforce payment-before-confirm and 48h cancellation window at the framework level — the LLM cannot bypass them. **Steering rules** (stored in DynamoDB, evaluated by `validate_booking_rules`) are softer: they return a STEER message guiding the agent to self-correct (e.g., "adjust guests to 10"). Steering rules can be changed in DynamoDB at any time without redeployment.
