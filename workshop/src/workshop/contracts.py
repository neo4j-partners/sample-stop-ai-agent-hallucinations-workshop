"""Frozen service and graph contracts for the grounded write path.

This module intentionally contains no AWS or Neo4j clients. It is safe to
import from local tests, notebooks, the Runtime package, and the reservation
Lambda without causing network calls or resource changes. `retrieval_contract`,
the one thing it does import, is pure constants and keeps that property.

The five embedding and index names are re-exported rather than redefined. Lab 1
writes the embeddings and creates the indexes; Lab 4 reads them. A second
definition here would let a reader change the index name in one file, pass every
test in that file's lab, and leave the write path pointed at an index the build
never created.
