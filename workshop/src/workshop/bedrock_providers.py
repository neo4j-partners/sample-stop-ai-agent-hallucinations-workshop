# botocore defaults to a 60s read timeout, so one hung call can burn minutes.
# graph_builder wraps each document in a 180s asyncio.wait_for, and that outer
# bound cannot govern a larger inner one: the timeout fires while the worker
# thread keeps running underneath, because a thread cannot be cancelled.
#
# Adaptive mode is what makes a room of thirty simultaneous Lab 1 builds
# survivable. It adds a client-side rate limiter that slows requests down when
# Bedrock starts returning throttling errors, instead of every participant
# retrying into the same per-region on-demand quota at full speed.
#
# botocore reads max_attempts as a retry count and normalises it to
# total_max_attempts, so 5 here is 6 total attempts. A throttling response comes
# back fast and costs backoff rather than a full read timeout, so those extra
# attempts are cheap in the case they exist for. The expensive case, six
# consecutive sockets that hang for the full 45s, adds up to 270s and outlasts
# the 180s per-document bound: the wait_for still fires and the build moves on,
# while the worker thread underneath keeps running to its own end. That is the
# trade being made here, throughput under throttling against a thread that can
# outlive its document. Raise DOC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS or lower read_timeout if you
# want the inner chain back inside the outer bound.
