"""Scoped cleanup for the inspectable Neo4j memory demo.

Removes exactly what the scenario notebook wrote:

1. Workshop-owned ``ABOUT_HOTEL`` relationships.
2. Conversations, messages, and users in the ``demo08-`` namespace.
3. Preferences tagged by this demo, but only after no user owns them.

The hotel graph, its chunk indexes, and other modules' data are untouched.
The library-managed memory vector indexes stay in place: they are shared
infrastructure, they cost nothing while empty, and the smoke test checks
them.

Requires live Neo4j credentials but no AWS access. Without them the script
prints a skip message and exits 0.

Run with:
    uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt python cleanup_memory.py
