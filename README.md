**AI agent hallucinations** occur when agents fabricate statistics, pick wrong tools, ignore business rules, or claim success when operations fail. This workshop provides 5 hands-on techniques — Graph-RAG, semantic tool selection, multi-agent validation, neurosymbolic guardrails, and agent steering — plus a production deployment demo on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

> Based on the Dev.to series [Stop AI Agent Hallucinations: 4 Essential Techniques](https://dev.to/aws/stop-ai-agent-hallucinations-4-essential-techniques-2i94) and [5 Techniques to Stop AI Agent Hallucinations in Production](https://dev.to/aws/5-techniques-to-stop-ai-agent-hallucinations-in-production-oik).

Built with [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com) and Amazon Bedrock. The same patterns apply in LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, or any other agent framework.

## Graph-RAG vs. Standard RAG: Why It Matters for Hallucinations

| Approach | Hallucination Risk | Retrieval Method | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard RAG (vector) | High — returns similar content even when irrelevant | Cosine similarity | General Q&A |
| Graph-RAG (Neo4j) | 73% lower per RAG-KG-IL, arXiv 2503.13514; grounded in entity relationships | Graph traversal + Cypher | Structured domains (hotels, products, finance) |

> **Key insight:** Vector search always returns *something similar*, even when the answer doesn't exist in the database — causing fabrication. Graph-RAG returns only what's explicitly connected in the knowledge graph.

## How Do the 6 Demos Build on Each Other?

Each demo builds on the previous one. You can run any demo independently, but the learning path is designed to be progressive:

**Phase 1 — Understand Failures:** Demos 01-02 show *why* agents fail — RAG hallucinations and tool selection errors backed by academic research.

**Phase 2 — Detect & Prevent:** Demos 03-04 show *how to catch* failures — multi-agent validation and symbolic rule enforcement.

**Phase 3 — Self-Correct:** Demo 05 shows *how to steer* agents to self-correct instead of blocking (Agent Control).

**Phase 4 — Deploy to Production:** Demo 06 shows *how to ship* all 5 techniques to production on AWS using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, DynamoDB, and Lambda.

---

## How Do I Run These Demos?

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- AWS account with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) access (Claude Sonnet 5 enabled in your region)

### Run Any Demo

```bash
cd 01-graphrag-demo   # or any demo folder
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
uv run <main_script>.py
# Or open the .ipynb notebook in your IDE (VS Code, Kiro, or any editor with notebook support)
```

Each demo README has specific setup instructions and prerequisites.

### Run Notebooks as Tests

The shared notebook runner uses `nbconvert` to execute source notebooks without
modifying them. It creates its own cached environment through `uv`, writes
executed notebooks to a temporary directory, and exits nonzero if a cell raises
an error:

```bash
uv run setup/run_notebooks.py              # Labs 00-05
uv run setup/run_notebooks.py --labs 4     # One lab
uv run setup/run_notebooks.py --labs 2-5   # A range
```

Labs 06 and 07 deploy AWS resources and require `--include-deploy`. Lab 08
deletes tagged workshop resources and requires `--include-cleanup`. See
[`setup/README.md`](setup/README.md) for the complete command reference.

### Notebook Setup (nbstripout)

This repository strips notebook output on commit through a git filter declared in `.gitattributes` (`*.ipynb filter=nbstripout diff=ipynb`). Register the filter once after cloning, or every `.ipynb` checkout runs against an undefined filter:

```bash
pip install nbstripout
nbstripout --install
```

Run both commands from the repository root. `nbstripout --install` writes the `filter.nbstripout` entries into your local git config so the `.gitattributes` rule resolves.

### Neo4j Setup (Demo 01)

Demo 01 requires a Neo4j instance to build and query the knowledge graph.

**Running as part of a workshop:** A Neo4j Aura instance will be provided. You will receive the connection credentials (`NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`) at the start of the session — add them to a `.env` file in `01-graphrag-demo/`.

**Running independently:** Create your own free Neo4j Aura instance:

1. Go to [console.neo4j.io](https://console.neo4j.io) and create a free **AuraDB** instance
2. Download the credentials file when prompted — it contains your URI, username, and password
3. Create a `.env` file in `01-graphrag-demo/`:
   ```
   NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<your-instance>.databases.neo4j.io
   NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   ```
4. Enable the **APOC** plugin in your Aura instance settings
5. Run `build_graph_lite.py` (30 docs, ~15 min) or `build_graph.py` (300 docs, ~2 hours) to populate the graph

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What types of AI agent hallucinations does this repository address?

This repository addresses four main categories: **(1)** fabricated statistics — when RAG agents guess numbers instead of computing them, **(2)** wrong tool selection — when agents pick inappropriate tools from large toolsets, **(3)** business rule violations — when agents ignore constraints expressed only in prompts, and **(4)** undetected failures — when single agents claim success without validation.

### Can I use these patterns with frameworks other than Strands Agents?

Yes. The patterns (Graph-RAG, semantic tool filtering, multi-agent validation, neurosymbolic guardrails, steering controls) are framework-agnostic concepts. These demos use Strands Agents, but the same approaches apply in LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Haystack, or custom implementations. The key insight is architectural, not framework-specific.

### Do I need an AWS account to run the demos?

Yes. All demos use Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 5) as the default LLM provider. You need an AWS account with Bedrock access enabled in your region.

### How long does it take to run each demo?

Demos 02-05 run in under 5 minutes. Demo 01 has a lite mode (30 docs, ~15 minutes) and full mode (300 docs, ~2 hours) for building the knowledge graph.

### What LLM providers are supported?

All demos default to Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 5) but work with any provider supported by Strands Agents: Anthropic API, OpenAI, Ollama (local models), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. See [Strands Model Providers](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/) for configuration.

---

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

**Bedrock access denied:** Ensure the model (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` or similar) is enabled in your region via the [Bedrock Model Access console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess).

**Neo4j connection fails (demo 01):** Verify `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` are set in your `.env` file and that APOC is enabled on your Aura instance.

**OpenTelemetry warnings:** "Failed to detach context" warnings in demos 03-05 are harmless and do not affect functionality.

**Model alternatives:** Change the model in any demo by modifying the `BedrockModel(model_id=...)` call. See [Strands Model Providers](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/) for all supported options.

For demo-specific issues, check the troubleshooting section in each demo's README.
